# TASK FRAMEWORK

> FOR THE COLLEGE CLUB TO STRUCTURE THE TEAM & IT’S ACTIVITIES



## I. Yearly repeating tasks

#### TEAM STRUCTURE

1.  Define the role of each member in the club.
    
2.  Assign roles to new members in the club or reassign roles to renewed members.
    
3.  Check if there are any other active groups/clubs inside college related to your club and restructure your club accordingly.
    

#### TEAM ACTIVITIES

1.  Plan some goals for the year ahead. You may link your goals with something that the club did previous year. If nothing has happened yet, set new goals.
    
2.  Consult with external (outside college) communities or organizations working in open technology (data, software, map, hardware, research, etc) to know the situation and activities of the overall communities.
    
3.  Decide either to organize yearly events in college and target a date. This event may be a remote event or an event with a venue. Yearly, there are global events such as Software Freedom Day, Open Data Day, Hardware Freedom Day, Open Access Week, etc. in which you may organize an event. Other national days such as National ICT Day or National Science Day can also be a proper day to organize such events.
    
4.  Target achievements with other related clubs or groups inside your college.
    
5.  Share and brief this ‘task framework’ to the new members in the club.
    

## II. Quarterly repeating tasks

#### TEAM STRUCTURE

1.  Have a meeting of the club, possibly including all the club's core members.
    
2.  Plan activities for next quarter. Activities such as learning, contribution, development, events or publishing.
    

#### TEAM ACTIVITIES

1.  Sharing reflection: This may include sharing what has been learned, anything that has been achieved, interesting findings or problems/situations to be solved.
    
2.  Cross learning: Contact with clubs of other colleges and set a date to share clubs’ knowledge either remotely or in-person. To make this meeting beneficial, define the need and purpose of the meeting very well.

##### Additional note
This ‘task framework’ is developed by Open Tech Community, with an intention to support building a career in open technologies and suggested to be followed by tech clubs inside a college/campus whose purpose is to learn and share the concept or contribute to and develop the products and services of open technologies.

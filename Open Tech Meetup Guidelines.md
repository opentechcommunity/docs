# Open Tech Meetup Guidelines

Welcome to the **Open Tech Meetup**! Our goal is to create a dynamic and inclusive environment where tech enthusiasts can come together, share ideas, and drive innovation. While we value flexibility and creativity, we also believe that some guidelines help ensure the success of our events. Here's what you can expect:

1. **Inclusivity:** Everyone is welcome, regardless of their background or expertise. We encourage diversity of thought and experience.

2. **Topic Variety:** We embrace a broad range of topics within the realm of open technology. Presentations, discussions, and workshops can cover anything from open-source software to hardware, ethics, and emerging trends.

3. **Informal Atmosphere:** Our meetups are relaxed and friendly. Feel comfortable, and free to bring your own unique flair to the event.

4. **Diverse Meetup Formats:** We take pride in our diverse range of meetup formats that set a benchmark for engagement. Whether it's a casual cafe meetup, an intellectually stimulating college meetup, an adventurous hiking meetup, or any other creative format you can think of, we encourage you to bring your unique ideas to the table. We would also love to see other clubs and communities adopt and adapt the culture and practices we've cultivated in our community.

5. **No Sales Pitches:** While networking and discussing your projects or ideas is encouraged, our meetups are not platforms for sales pitches or self-promotion. Let's focus on knowledge sharing.

6. **Respectful Discussions:** Respectful and constructive communication is paramount. Disagreements are okay, but they should be handled with courtesy and an open mind.

7. **Collaboration:** We encourage attendees to collaborate, exchange contact information, and work together on projects or initiatives that emerge during the event.

8. **Time Management:** We understand that different events have different levels of formality. For more formal events, we adhere to a strict schedule to ensure that sessions start and end on time. However, for casual meetups, we often begin with a dedicated period for formal discussions. Once the allocated time is up, we transition into more casual and open-ended discussions, allowing attendees to engage at their own pace.

9. **Outcome:** We value your input and the tangible outcomes of our meetups. After each event, we encourage attendees to share the results, insights gained, and any collaborative projects or initiatives that emerged during the meetup. Let's not only discuss ideas but also work together to achieve meaningful outcomes.

10. **Innovation and Disruption:** We embrace disruptive ideas and innovation. Feel free to challenge the status quo and push the boundaries of what's possible in the tech world.

11. **Social Media Engagement:** Share your insights, highlights, and photos on social media using our event's official hashtag. Let's spread the word about open technology!

Remember that while we have these guidelines, we also encourage spontaneity and creativity. Our meetups are platforms for you to shape and make your own. Let's come together, learn, collaborate, and drive innovation!
